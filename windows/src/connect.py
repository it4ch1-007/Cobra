# We will have a premade list in which the ips and files are mapped 
# After opening the python file it will check if the malware is running on any of the client
# If it is it will show  it to us
# It will check this by trying to connect to it but will close it at first time.
# Now we will choose the ip we want to connect to and we will open the connection to that 
# The rust main file should continue listening no matter what happens and will run the handle client function once the connection is made again.
# We will send the commands to the rust file and it will execute it with a background process.
# After the execution of the dll injection and all the malware will remain connected to the server and will spawn a child process in which it will run all the options and malicious payloads.
# The main thread will be there only for the connection and as the main thread receives some commands it will kill some particular or all the threads.
# The command thing will also e like an option. The main thread will be there only for the connection.
# for this we will make a child process.
# At the first execution we will move the ps1 files and all the other files from the links to the hidden directory.
